My research focuses on developing AI methods for molecular biology and protein design, with a focus on medical applications.
I work at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and computational biology, using deep sequencing data to train AI models that generate optimized biomolecules.
My research combines fundamental work with practical applications. I collaborate with experimental groups to design specific antibodies, cancer-targeting peptides, and viral capsids.

By applying AI to molecular biology, I am committed to creating data-driven solutions that accelerate the discovery and optimization of biomolecules for medical purposes.
